# Mic Platform v4

## Project Overview
A new version of the Mic Platform, rebuilt with Tauri 2.0, React, and TypeScript. This project aims to provide a modern, cross-platform desktop application with a focus on performance and a smaller bundle size compared to its Electron predecessor.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Backend**: Rust (via Tauri)
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Project Structure
The project is located in the `app` directory. The structure is generated by Tauri and follows standard practices for a React/Vite project with a Rust backend.
```
app/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   └── ...
├── src-tauri/
│   ├── src/
│   └── Cargo.toml
├── public/
├── package.json
└── ...
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use consistent code formatting tools (e.g., Prettier, rustfmt)
- Follow language-specific best practices for TypeScript and Rust
- Keep code clean and readable

### Naming Conventions
- File naming: (e.g., `kebab-case` for files, `PascalCase` for components)
- Variable naming: `camelCase`
- Function naming: `camelCase`
- Class naming: `PascalCase`

### Git Workflow
- Branch naming conventions (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `chore/`)
- Commit message format (e.g., Conventional Commits)
- Pull Request process

## Environment Setup

### Development Requirements
- **Node.js and npm:** [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Rust:** Install from [https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
- **OS-specific dependencies:** Follow the instructions for your operating system here: [https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

### Installation Steps
```bash
# 1. Navigate to the app directory
cd app

# 2. Install dependencies
